# KOL Patreon Tracker
KOL Patreon Tracker is a Chromium extension and Edge addon that helps you track KingOfLightning (KOL) reactions on Patreon.
KOL is an Anime/Manga YouTuber who mostly does One Piece content and other reactions and theories.

Recently, Patreon has started taking down copyrighted content, so KOL stopped tagging his reactions with the shows' names to avoid detection.
This extension adds tags back and provides a simple tracking list for the shows you've watched the reactions for.
It also helps you better seek reactions by skipping forward to when they start on KOL's streams, which can be long (over 6 hours sometimes).

## Features
- Adds tags back to KOL's reactions on Patreon to help identify the shows being reacted to.
- Provides a simple tracking list to keep track of the shows you've watched the reactions for.
- Helps you seek reactions by skipping forward to when they start on KOL's streams.

## Usage
Once the KOL Patreon Tracker extension is installed, you can use it to track KOL's reactions on Patreon:

1. Go to KOL's Patreon page on Patreon.com.
2. Browse through the reactions and you'll see that the tags are added back to the reactions, helping you identify the shows being reacted to.
3. Click on the "Track" button next to a reaction to add it to your tracking list.
4. You can view your tracking list by clicking on the extension's icon in your browser's toolbar and selecting "My Tracking List". You can also remove reactions from your tracking list from this view.
5. To seek reactions, click on the "Skip to Reactions" button on KOL's Patreon page. The extension will automatically skip forward to when the reactions start in KOL's streams, helping you save time.
